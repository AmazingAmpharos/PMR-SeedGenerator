# Open World PM64

## General
The player spawns in Toad Town with the ability to immediately travel to any chapter. Certain roadblocks are removed to facilitate this: Fuzzipede can be battled right away, the stone blocking the railway is not there, etc. On the other hand, the bridge to Goomba village is not open and Kent C Koopa is guarding Pleasant Path. The route after taking the portal to Star Way in Shooting Star Summit is always unchanged. Thus, the object of each seed is to rescue enough star spirits to open this portal. The default number required is 7, but lower values can be left as an option. The difficulty of each chapter is also randomized in order to encourage novel routes through the game with each seed playthrough.

All partners are “unlocked” at the start of a new game, with all their abilities available and all side quests / scenes requiring particular partners unlocked. However, only one (at random according to the seed) is available in battle. The others are unlocked by visiting their chapter and obtaining them in the usual way. Missing partners appear as ghosts in the overworld, cannot first-strike enemies, and are swapped out when a battle is initiated. This arrangement is chosen to maximize freedom of exploration when starting a new seed and to eliminate complications arising from not having partners for scenes which require them. It may prove useful later to have an option to disable their abilities as well until they are unlocked.

Hammer and boot equipment upgrades are always in the large chests.

Progressive star spirit unlocks may also be necessary (unlocking the Nth star spirit gives you access to the Nth ability), which means the star spirit rescued in each chapter must be adjusted accordingly.

## Damage
Several options available for increased damage:
* have a dropdown for selecting normal damage scale: 1x, 2x, 4x
* have a checkbox for OHKO on missed block

## Shops

Each item has a default price greater than its sale value. The price can be randomly adjusted by -25%, -10%, +10%, or +25% (and maybe more?). Each shop has a base price premium, increasing with “local difficulty”, which is added to the item sale price before the random scaling.

## Chuck Quizmo

Chuck Quizmo appears in 17 distinct locations across 7 areas of the world. In this hack, he will only offer a certain number of questions in each area before he will not appear there anymore. Each area has an exclusive subset of the questions, which may be subject to randomization. In most areas he offers 8 questions, and in Toad Town he offers 16 which will unlock progressively with the number of Star Spirits rescued. When a question is answered correctly, the player is prompted to continue to the next question immediately.
